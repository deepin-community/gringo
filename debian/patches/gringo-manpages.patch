+\fBclingo\fP stands for clasp on gringo and combines both systems in a
+monolithic way. Its input language is that of gringo and its output
+corresponds to that of clasp. This way it offers more control over the
+grounding and solving process than gringo and clasp can offer
+individually: multi-shot solving.
+.SH OPTIONS
+These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
+options starting with two dashes (`-').
+A summary of options is included below.

+.PP
+.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and

+\fBgringo\fP is a grounder that, given an input program with first-order
+variables, computes an equivalent ground (variable-free) program in
+aspif format. Its output can be processed further with answer set solver
+clasp. Starting with gringo series 5, its output is no longer directly
+compatible with solvers like smodels or cmodels reading smodels format.
+Use the \fBlpconvert\fP converter for translating aspif format to
+smodels format.
